  My name is Ellen! I discovered programming in grad school, where I found that I really loved the coding aspect of my
    quantitative analysis courses. After I graduated, I worked as a Data Analyst at a state agency. I found that my favorite
    part of the job was writing and verifying SQL queries with the data engineer from IT, so I chose to become a software
    developer! Right now I'm a student at Code Fellows, where I help hypothetical salmon cookie bakers make beautiful
    websites that keep track of their sales data.

   My name is Elhadji NDOUR. I am Senegalese and teacher by profession. After obtaining my master debiology, 
     I have 7 years   experience in teaching biology in high school. I have always liked IT but I did not have the opportunity to study them.
     So some time after my arrival in Seattle I discovered Code Fellows that proposes a great program that interested me. So I decided 
     to start a new adventure, a new career: Learn to become a Software Developer.</p>
